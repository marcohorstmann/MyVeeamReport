<# 
	ED V12 11082023 Only email report if report has data other than a blank html page.
	Experimental. 
	Tested with: 
	 "Get SureBackup Tasks with Warnings or Failures" using $showTaskWFSb and $ReportSBFailingOnly
	 "Get VMs Missing Backups" using "$missingVMsEmail="SendEmailReport""

	For SB or "VMs Missing" if the list has no failed VM's then don't send the email. 
	 
#>
#The default is "$ReportHasDataEmail = $false" to ignore this setting.
#$ReportHasDataEmail = $true
$ReportHasDataEmail = $false

<#

	ED V11 and V12
	Only report a SB fail VM if that same VM never passed in the time frame.
	If your only interested in SB VM's that fail consistently over the time frame. 
	Example. You test VM's every week. Your time span is one month. If a VM fails every week then send email/log a ticket. If a VM passes even once then don't send email. 
	Use with all setting set to $false, "$showTaskWFSb = $true" and "$ReportSBFailingOnly = $true".
