# MyVeeam Report for Veeam Backup & Replication v11a
Hi, this is a "little" powershell script which creates an instant configurable report about all stuff in your Veeam Backup and Replication environment. Because of my limited testlab capacity I'm only able to test with the current GA release of Veeam. 
## Whatâ€™s New
Current version is mainly an updated version of Shawn original script and enhancements written by several people. See [Contribution](#contribution) section of this document.
## Disclaimer
The maintainer of this repository is employed by Veeam, but the maintenance and improvement of this project is not related to that. This is a pure community project, because I have fun to support something like this and have seen that many people were also very sad when Shawn stopped maintaining the project.
## Contribution
First of all I want to thank Shawn Masterson, who created this script but abandoned it in 2018. I always used this script to figure out stuff in Veeam Powershell when started to work with it.

If you want to enhance and improve this script please help and create issues with maybe requests for enhancement or bug reports. 

Of cause would be, when you can contribute some code of create pull requests to donate your enhancements.
